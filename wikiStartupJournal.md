# wikiStartupJournal

- notes on reviewing and testing the startup instructions for Massive
  Wiki `massive-wiki-starter` repo and for MassiveWikiBuilder  
  
2023-07-20  

- created my own `mwStarterWiki` repository from a template of the
  `massive-wiki-starter` repo  
  
- cloned that repo to my local Mac  

- copied a couple of Markdown files from another wiki, just to have
  some content for basic testing  
- added this startup journal file to keep notes and also to have some
  wiki content  
  
- use `git` from the command line to push the new content to the repo
